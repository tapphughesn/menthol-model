# Smoking Behavior Simulation Model

This repository contains all the code (but not the data) used for our smoking behavior simulation model.

The main files of interest are:

- simulation.py - The main code for the simulation behavior lives here
- uncertainty_analysis_create_params.py & uncertainty_analysis_do_runs.py - This code orchestrates the uncertainty analysis--the process of randomly varying simulation parameters so that we can see how simulation results look over a large number of slightly different runs.
