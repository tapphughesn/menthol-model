These datasets are used in the simulation model.
The filenames and brief descriptions are listed.

1. Life Tables
Filename(s):
    life_table_2016_male.xlsx
    life_table_2017_male.xlsx
    life_table_2018_male.xlsx
    life_table_2016_female.xlsx
    life_table_2017_female.xlsx
    life_table_2018_female.xlsx
Description:
    The life tables contain the probability of death based on a person's age and sex.
    These are averages from the US population. They are used to calculate death rates in each year.

2. Initial Population
Filename(s):
    population_file_sent_Feb8.xlsx
Description:
    The initial population in 2016, based on PATH data. Each of the ~19000 rows is an individual
    that gets simulated. Each row contains some data for the individual that are used as covariates
    in the logistic regression model. The "weight" column shows how many people in the adult US
    population are represented by this row. Once this population file is read by the simulation
    program, it is usually translated into a better format for computaitons. 

3. Cohorts of 18-year-olds
Filename(s):
    Wave 2 fresh population profile.xlsx
    Wave 3 fresh population profile.xlsx
    Wave 4 fresh population profile.xlsx
    postban population profile.xlsx
Description:
    These are similar to the initial population file. These files also describe a population.
    However, rather than being representative of the whole adult US population, they are 
    representative of the population of 18-year-olds in 2015 (Wave 2 of the PATH study), 2016 (Wave 
    3), and 2017 (Wave 4). The 'postban population profile' is used some years after the simulated
    menthol ban--it is based on the Wave 4 cohort of 18-year-olds, but has much less smokers while
    maintaining the same overall population. These are used to add new population into the 
    simulation each year so that we can continue to simulate the whole adult population. 

4. Beta Parameters
Filename(s):
    Beta_Estimates_2345.xlsx
    Beta_Estimates_1.xlsx
Description:
    These are the parameters we estimated for a multinomial logistic regression model that predicts
    an individual's smoking state in 2017 based on covariates from 2016. The logistic regression
    model was trained on PATH data. The parameters were estimated before the simulation was built.
    The model is used during the simulation to infer an individual's smoking state each year, based
    on covariates from last year.

5. Relative Risk Information
Filename(s):
    csvns_bounds.xlsx
    fsvcs_bounds_adjusted.xlsx
Description:
    These tables contain the relative risks of all-cause mortality of one smoking status group to
    another. The filenames use the acronyms Current Smoker Versus Non Smoker (csvns) and Former
    Smoker Versus Non Smoker (fsvcs). For example, the fsvcs table can tell you the relative risk
    of all-cause mortality of a male former smoker who has quit for 2-4 years vs one who is a
    current smoker.

6. Smoking Rate Percentages
Filename(s):
    Smoker_percentage16_M.xlsx
    Smoker_percentage17_M.xlsx
    Smoker_percentage18_M.xlsx
    Smoker_percentage16_F.xlsx
    Smoker_percentage17_F.xlsx
    Smoker_percentage18_F.xlsx
Description:
    These tables contain the average smoking rate of US adults, stratified by age and sex.

7. NHIS/BRFSS Smoking Rates
Filename(s):
    NHIS_state_age_Sep2022.xlsx
    BRFSSNHIS_Jiaqian.xlsx
    NHIS_state_Jiaqian_Oct2023.xlsx
    NHIS_state_age18_64.xlsx
Description: 
    Contains smoking rate data from NHIS and BRFSS. The table 'NHIS_state_age_Sep2022.xlsx' is used
    to calibrate the initiation/cessation rate used in the model. The other tables are used for
    tables and figures comparing the model outputs to external estimations of smoking rates.
